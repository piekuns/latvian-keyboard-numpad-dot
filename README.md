# latvian-keyboard-numpad-dot

The standard Latvian keyboard layout has a persistent issue: the Numpad always uses a comma (,) as the decimal separator. Even if you change your Windows regional settings to a dot (.), the Numpad continues to output a comma.
This custom keyboard layout fixes that issue. It was created using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator and has been tested on Windows 10 x64 (build 22H2).
Installation Instructions:
    Download all files from this repository into a single folder on your computer.
    Run setup.exe.
    Follow the on-screen prompts.
Once finished, you can select the new layout from your language settings, and your Numpad will now use a dot as the decimal separator!
